1) Fix reliability issues with cam monitor/website. Make sure it launches 
without error 100% of the time. Probably do something with auto detection of 
cameras and make sure that we can handle cases where a camera isnt actually 
plugged in

2) Email log files (last XYZ lines of main.out?) to me every night to assist 
with debugging on trips

3) Create IP logger script to parse IP addresses from log files

4) Stress test this with multiple accesses from multiple devices, how do things
handle? 

5) LONG TERM: Make this website actually look nice. Learn how to front-end for once. Build a better API around this and document it
